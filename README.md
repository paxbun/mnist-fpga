# Running inference model for MNIST using FPGAs

# How to build and launch

* Install C++17 feature-complete compiler.

Ubuntu 18.04 is shipped with GCC 7, which does not contain some of the standard headers of the C++17 standard. `mnist-fpga` is written in C++17. To properly build the project, please install GCC 8 or higher (or Clang 11 or higher).
For example, you can install GCC 9 by the following commands:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-9
```

* Configure CMake with `VITIS_ROOT`

Use `-D` flag to set `VITIS_ROOT` to the root directory of Vitis. If directories containing `v++` is already in `PATH`, you may skip this.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DVITIS_ROOT=/opt/Xilinx/Vitis/2020.1 -G "<generator name here>" ..
```

* Build

Build the project with `cmake --build`.
```
cmake --build .
```

* Launch

Set `XILINX_XRT` (environmental variable) to the root directory of Xilinx Runtime. If `XILINX_XRT` is not properly set, the executable will fail to find the FPGA to use.
```
export XILINX_XRT=/opt/Xilinx/xrt
./mnist-fpga
```

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can do the same by adding configuration to `.vscode/launch.json`.
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Launch",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${command:cmake.launchTargetPath}",
      "args": [],
      "environment": [
        {
          "name": "XILINX_XRT",
          "value": "opt/Xilinx/xrt"
        }
      ]
      // more options here
    }
  ]
}
```
